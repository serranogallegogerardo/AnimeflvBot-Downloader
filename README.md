### AnimeflvBot-Downloader.bat Readme

#### How to Use:

1. Execute `AnimeflvBot-Downloader.bat`.
2. If it's your first time, you'll need to install all dependencies.
3. Enter the name of the anime you want, for example, "Berserk" or "Boku no Hero".
4. You'll then be able to retrieve all episodes in JSON format.

#### Recommendations:

- I recommend using Mipony for downloading. Alternatively, if you have a Mega premium account, you can use that.
